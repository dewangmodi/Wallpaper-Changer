# Wallpaper-Changer

This is a script written using Python, which allows one to schedule the process of scraping and changing their wallpaper.


## Installation

### Using pip

Installing the modules 'requests' and 'bs4' should suffice.
You can do that using 
```sh
pip install requests
pip install bs4
``` 


## Description

As you can see, the project has two files - main.py and schedule.py
main.py is used for general interaction with the script. The features right now are 


1. Changing wallpaper now
2. Changing schedule config
3. View current config


schedule.py has the actual code which uses the config files and changes the wallpaper.


As of now, Ubuntu users need to manually schedule it using cron and Windows users need to schedule it using Windows Scheduler.
